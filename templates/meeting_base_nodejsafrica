* Link for participants: <https://zoom.us/j/526318636>
* We stream our conference call straight to YouTube so anyone can listen to it live.
  It should start playing at <https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+africa/live> when we turn it on.
  There's usually a short cat-herding time at the start of the meeting and then occasionally we
  have some quick private business to attend to before we can start recording & streaming.
  So be patient and it should show up.
