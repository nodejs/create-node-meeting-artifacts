Uberconference; participants should have the link & numbers, contact me if you don't.

## Public participation

We stream our conference call straight to YouTube so anyone can listen to it live, it should start playing at **<https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation/live>** when we turn it on. There's usually a short cat-herding time at the start of the meeting and then occasionally we have some quick private business to attend to before we can start recording & streaming. So be patient and it should show up.

Many of us will be on IRC in #node-dev on Freenode if you'd like to interact, we have a Q/A session scheduled at the end of the meeting if you'd like us to discuss anything in particular. @nodejs/collaborators in particular if there's anything you need from the TSC that's not worth putting on as a separate agenda item, this is a good place for that"
