This document contains empty versions of each template needed to successfully create meeting artifacts for a Committee, Working Group, Initiative, or Team. These documents need to go in the [/templates](./templates) directory in this repository.

## Template Variables

There are several variables in the documents that need to be configured:

- **`<name>`:** The name of the Committee, Working Group, Initiative, or Team that meeting artifacts are being created for.
- **`<shortname>`:** The abbreviated or shortened name for a group, used in each filename to connect associated files together.
- **`<team_name>`:** The name of the GitHub team in the Node.js org.
- **`<calendar event name>`:** The name of calendar events that mark the group's meeting date/time.
- **`<repo>`:** The repository of the group.
- **`<agenda-label>`:** The label for which to search the Node.js GitHub organization, to add items to the group's agenda.
- **`<issue-label>`:** an optional label for the created issue itself.
- **`<observer>`:** Name of an observer in a group's meetings.

## Meeting Properties Reference

The following properties are available in meeting base templates and can be used in meeting issue generation:

- **`CALENDAR_FILTER`:** The name of calendar events that mark the group's meeting date/time
- **`CALENDAR_ID`:** The Google Calendar ID for the Node.js calendar (typically `nodejs.org_nr77ama8p7d7f9ajrpnu506c98@group.calendar.google.com`)
- **`USER`:** The GitHub username/organization (typically `nodejs`)
- **`REPO`:** The repository name where meeting issues are created
- **`GROUP_NAME`:** The full name of the Committee, Working Group, Initiative, or Team
- **`AGENDA_TAG`:** The label used to search for agenda items in GitHub issues and PRs
- **`HOST`:** Meeting host information
- **`JOINING_INSTRUCTIONS`:** Instructions for joining the meeting (Zoom links, YouTube streams, etc.)
- **`ISSUE_LABEL`:** Optional label to apply to the created meeting issue

These properties are defined in the `meeting_base_<shortname>` template files and are substituted when generating meeting issues.
